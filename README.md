![Dependency Diagram](/deps.png)

This repository produces a set of binaries suitable for building a target Linux distribution.
All binaries are produced with a search path of `/toolchain/lib`, allowing for an independent set of build dependencies.
We recommend using these tools with an adjusted toolchain (produces binaries with standard search paths).
